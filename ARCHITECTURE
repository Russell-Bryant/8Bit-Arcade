System Architecture Overview
Web Interface: The website is built and hosted on Webflow, which serves as the primary user interface. Users interact with various content on the platform, including embedded games and Singularity's authentication system, both incorporated via iframes. An additional feature allows users to upload their own games through the Webflow interface.
Authentication System: Singularity is utilized for managing user authentication. Upon a user's successful login, Singularity is responsible for generating a unique identifier (token or similar), which is used by the application to maintain a consistent identification of the user throughout their session.
Game Storage: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is used to store the game files. Existing games are already stored and are accessible through the Webflow site. GCS also acts as the repository for user-uploaded game files.
Server-side Operations: Google Cloud Functions (GCF) is employed to execute server-side operations. These operations include handling file uploads from the Webflow site and subsequently storing them in GCS.
Session Management: To ensure each game session is unique per user, a combination of the user's unique identifier from Singularity and a unique game identifier is used. These unique game sessions are created and managed within the GCFs whenever a user initiates a game.
Database: A database is used to store and track information about game sessions, linking them to the respective users. Possible choices for this component include Google Firestore or Google Cloud SQL, the selection of which would depend on specific needs and requirements.
Note: The architecture is designed to be as simple and streamlined as possible. Hence, while other services like Netlify could potentially add more functionality, they are currently not included unless a clear need for additional complexity arises.
